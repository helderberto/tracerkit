Spec-driven workflow for Claude Code: from idea to product requirements to executable plan.

**Zero runtime dependencies** — pure Markdown skills, no build step.

</div>

## Get Started

### 1. Install TracerKit

```bash
npx tracerkit init
```

Skills are installed globally to `~/.claude/skills/` — available in every project, no per-project setup needed.

### 2. Use the skills

Open Claude Code in any project and start using:

```bash
/tk:prd add dark mode support     # define the feature
/tk:plan dark-mode-support        # break into vertical slices
/tk:verify dark-mode-support      # verify and archive
```

### 3. CLI Reference

| Command                    | Description                                    |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `tracerkit init`           | Install skills to `~/.claude/skills/`          |
| `tracerkit init <path>`    | Install skills to a specific project directory |
| `tracerkit update`         | Refresh to latest version, skip modified files |
| `tracerkit update --force` | Replace modified files with latest versions    |
| `tracerkit uninstall`      | Remove TracerKit skills, keep user artifacts   |
| `tracerkit --version`      | Print version                                  |
| `tracerkit --help`         | Show help message                              |

All commands default to the home directory. Pass a path to target a specific project.

<details>
<summary>Per-project usage</summary>

To scope skills to a single project (team members get them via git):

```bash
npx tracerkit init .              # install to .claude/skills/ in current dir
npx tracerkit update .            # update project-scoped skills
npx tracerkit uninstall .         # remove project-scoped skills
```

</details>

## Skills

### Core skills

The three-step workflow that takes a feature from idea to verified archive.

#### `/tk:prd <idea>` — Write a PRD

Interactive interview to define a feature. Explores the codebase, asks scoping questions one at a time, designs deep modules, and writes a structured PRD.

**Output:** `prds/<slug>.md`

#### `/tk:plan <slug>` — Create an implementation plan

Reads a PRD and breaks it into phased **tracer-bullet vertical slices** — each phase is a thin but complete path through every layer (schema, service, API, UI, tests), demoable on its own.

**Output:** `plans/<slug>.md`

#### `/tk:verify <slug>` — Verify and archive

Read-only review that compares the codebase against the plan's done-when conditions. Runs tests, checks user stories, and stamps a **PASS** or **NEEDS_WORK** verdict. On PASS, automatically archives the PRD and plan to `archive/<slug>/`.

**Output:** Verdict block in `plans/<slug>.md` — on PASS: `archive/<slug>/prd.md` + `archive/<slug>/plan.md`

### Helper skills

Useful but optional — this category will grow over time.

#### `/tk:status` — Workflow dashboard

Scans `prds/` and prints a table of all features grouped by status (`in_progress`, `created`, `done`), with age, latest verdict, and blocker/suggestion counts. Read-only — no files are modified.

## Metadata Lifecycle

Each PRD carries YAML frontmatter that tracks its position in the workflow. The skills update it automatically — you never need to edit it by hand.

**Fields:**

- `created` — ISO 8601 UTC timestamp, set when the PRD is written
- `status` — `created` | `in_progress` | `done`
- `completed` — ISO 8601 UTC timestamp, set when verification passes

**How it changes:**

| Stage    | Skill               | Frontmatter                                          |
| -------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Defined  | `/tk:prd`           | `created: 2025-06-15T14:30:00Z`<br>`status: created` |
| Planning | `/tk:plan`          | `status: in_progress`                                |
| Verified | `/tk:verify` (PASS) | `status: done`<br>`completed: 2025-06-20T09:00:00Z`  |

After `/tk:verify` (PASS):

## Why TracerKit?

Most planning tools produce horizontal task lists — nothing works until everything is done. TracerKit uses **tracer-bullet vertical slices** instead: each phase cuts through every layer (schema → service → API → UI → tests), so every phase is demoable on its own. Integration problems surface early, context stays focused, and AI assistants get small well-scoped phases instead of sprawling layers.

The term comes from [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/).

### Compared to

**vs. [Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit)** (GitHub) — Thorough but heavyweight. 5 phases, Python setup, rigid phase gates. TracerKit is 3 phases, zero deps, automated verification.

**vs. [Kiro](https://kiro.dev/)** (AWS) — Powerful but locked to a dedicated IDE. TracerKit works inside Claude Code with pure Markdown skills.

**vs. [OpenSpec](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec)** — Similar philosophy, broader tool support. TracerKit trades breadth (Claude Code only) for depth — native skill discovery, subagents for verification, and fewer artifacts.

**vs. nothing** — AI coding without specs means vague prompts and lost context between sessions. TracerKit adds structure without ceremony.
